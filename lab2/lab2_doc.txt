Lab 2 Description

This is a backup submission in case Victor has not submitted.
In the lab, Mengye is in charge of writing the grammar rules and Viktor is in
charge of writing tests to make sure the parser functions correctly.
Most of the work is copying the grammar rules from the lab pdf file to bison 
file. There was one problem relating to the precedence. We found out that the
order of precedence list is bottom-up, with the least priority on the top. We
also found out that there is no need to define a grammar rule called "binary 
op". If "binary op" is defined, then bison cannot figure out the precedence 
rule as "binary op" makes it ambiguous. The correct way is directly writing 
the grammar rules in to "expression". Lastly, we can define the negative sign
through %prec to disambiguify it from the minus sign, since they have different
precedence.
In "test_cases_success.txt", we wrote a test program to make sure the parser 
functions. We not only check for the correct tree structure of ambiguous if 
statement, but also the operator precedence.
